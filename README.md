Created for the Spring 2018 Humans vs. Zombies Game.

# How it Works
1. QR codes with the links to the webpages were placed at locations around campus.
2. Players had to find the QR codes and navigate to the page in their web browsers.
3. They had to hold the connect button and remain in the area until the code word was revealed.
